          Why do developers use logging?

          • Debugging (appending debug statements into the log)
          • Unrecoverable errors (database unavailable, OOME, etc.)
          • Journaling (writing business-related events or audits)
          • Tracing (printing method invocations, arguments, and stacks)
          • Monitoring (appending business or technical metrics to the log)
          • Health checks (writing status messages to ensure liveness)
