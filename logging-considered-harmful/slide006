          Challenge: Performance

          • Logs have (one of) the biggest impact in JVM performance
          • Java heap allocations (byte[]), disproportionally high
          • High allocation rates will hyper-activate GC
          • Disk I/O
          • Network I/O (NFS, etc.)
          -> Noisy neighbor
