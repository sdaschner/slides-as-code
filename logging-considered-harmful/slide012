          Challenge: Log Formats

          • Which information to include
          • How to structure the logging messages
          • Often (always?) no clear strategy & guidance -> default config
          • Aimed to be "human-readable" yet the amount of data
            creates the necessity for additional tooling
          • Ability to use machine-readable formats (e.g. JSON)
